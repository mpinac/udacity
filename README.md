## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The libraries needed to run the project are: numpy, pandas and matplotlib.  The code has been validated with Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

The main interest of this project has been to analyze the open data provided by Seattle Airbnb and to answer the following questions:

1. Which are the most expensive days to make a reservation?
2. What is the evolution of booking prices over the course of a year?
3. How do booking prices evolve depending on the type of property?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

One notebook is available, in which all the work necessary to answer the above questions has been developed. The notebook contains a large number of comments and is therefore self-explanatory..  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@miguel.pina_55772/seattle-airbnb-anyone-give-more-babc61aeb07a).
